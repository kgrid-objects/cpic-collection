## CPIC Knowledge Objects (KO)
This is a collection of objects that focus on dosing guidelines as provided by
 the [CPIC pharmacogenomic guidelines](https://cpicpgx.org/guidelines/). These objects generally 
 take allele pairs as inputs and return the corresponding drug selection or dosing guideline 
 recommendation based on a patient's alleles.
